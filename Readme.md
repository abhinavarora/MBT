## Model Based testing and Test Case Prioritization using Genetic Algorithm

Model Based Testing is a technique that helps shift this important phase of the SDLC from its end to the beginning of the life cycle i.e. to the Requirement Analysis phase. This helps in ensuring a better quality of the software so developed, and also helps reduce effort during testing at a later stage.

This work aims to extend the technique of Model Based Testing to assign priorities to test cases, so generated from various UML (2.0) diagrams,according to their significance or probability of detecting a bug. These test cases are prioritized using Genetic Algorithm technique.
